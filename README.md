Self-contained chess puzzle trainer — pure HTML/JS, no server, just tactics.

## Why?

I made this for myself and my son. We both enjoy chess puzzles, but online trainers come with rankings that go up and down. My boy gets upset when his rating drops after a failed puzzle.

[Lichess puzzles](https://lichess.org/training) are fantastic — if you're happy with them, just don't bother. But if you want to train your favorite collections (from PGN) without ratings or pressure, Czesia might help.

## How it was made

This whole thing came together in a few hours of pair-programming with AI coding agents — [Claude](https://claude.ai) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com). Turns out they're pretty good at turning ideas into working code.

## Thanks to

This project stands on the shoulders of two great libraries:

- **[Chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground)** — the beautiful, responsive chessboard (from Lichess)
- **[chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)** — the brains behind move validation

Huge thanks to their authors for making chess development so accessible.
